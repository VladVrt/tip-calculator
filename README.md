# tip-calculator
This is a handy calculator when you need to quickly calculate the amount of tip that you want to give.
It gives you the ability to choose the number of persons, the service quality, it gives you the amount of tip that you've given so far, and the tip history.
This project is my final project from Code4Sp course, the purpose of it is to practice what I've learned so far.
